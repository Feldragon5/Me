# Matthew McWilliam's Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website that showcases some of my web projects.  
You can view the site at https://feldragon5.github.io/Me/

## Pages

-   **Home Page**: A welcome page with animated text.
-   **About Me**: A page listing some of my interests.
-   **My Stuff**: A showcase with links to some of my projects.
-   **Contact**: Links to my email and GitHub profile.

## Expansion Ideas

-   **improve some animations**
-   **add more project links**
-   **make the currently selected project show the hover effect even after being unhovered**
-   **make the link handle on the mystuff page appear only after a project is selected**
-   **improve styling**
-   **compile the tailwind**
